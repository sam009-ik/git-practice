Hi
this is test2

We can unstage changes? git reset HEAD file_name

Let's stage this change and then unstage it

we can print put the git log? git log file_name

We can reset a commit by using the first 7 hashes of a unique commit? git reset 
####### SHA hash 
Once we reset any commit with a commit_SHA -> HEAD wil now point to that commit 
effectively removing any changes/commits made to newer commits
also takes in:
--hard
--soft
--mixed
Let's add this and commit the above, and then will make a test commit to undo
