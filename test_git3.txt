Hi This is test3
If you reset to a previous commit..the newer commits are not entirely lost
use? git reflog ?git reference log to access the commits which might have been discarded
I will make the above commit and then make another which i will reset.



But first let's merge the recovery-branch with the master branch
 use? git checkout master ?to shift the working-directory to master
//This is a test commit which i want to reset
