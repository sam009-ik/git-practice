Hi
testing git
Testing it further to see changes in in this file 
i can see the difference with git diff file_name

To save changes in the nano editor? CTRL + O
How do i exit the nano editor? CTRL + X

There are three stages: working directory -> staging area -> commit
To add to staging area? git add file_name
M- means meta data, to use with alt
^ means control-key

I can only see diff/changes before i add them to the staging area
use? git commit -m "This is a commit message" to commit changes
